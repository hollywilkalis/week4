# Epicodus Review Project Week Four

#### Demo page for hypothetical restaurant When Pizza Goes Wrong, November 2017

#### By Holly Wilkalis

## Description
Project specifications are:

* Create form that will allow user to select a pizza size from a dropdown list
	Sample Input:	 	[small]
	Sample Output: 	[small]


* Add function to form to allow user to also select one or more desired toppings
	Sample Input: 		[small], [pepperoni, sardines]
	Sample Output: 		[small], [pepperoni, sardines]


* The form's business logic will calculate a price for the pizza order based on the size and topping choices input by the user.
	Sample Input:		[small], [pepperoni, sardines]
	Sample Output: 	[$14]

* Based on these calculations, the form will display information about the user's order, including the final price.
  Sample input: user orders a small pizza with pepperoni and sardines.
  Sample output: "You have ordered a small pizza with 2 toppings. The cost will be $14."

* The form should reset after every use, allowing the user to calculate the cost of new orders without refreshing the page.
